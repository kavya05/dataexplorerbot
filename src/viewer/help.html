  <blockquote>Do we have any open critical tickets?</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Were there any tickets due during last 7 days?</blockquote>
  <h3>E.g. to do some basic calculations</h3>
  <blockquote>What is the average age of open tickets?</blockquote>
  <blockquote>What is the average age of open tickets created during last 7 days?</blockquote>
  <h3>E.g. or just to view them</h3>
  <blockquote>Which tickets were created during last 2 weeks?</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Which tickets are due tomorrow?</blockquote>
  <h3>And finally, you can ask for me to show them to you</h3>
  <blockquote>Can I see them?</blockquote>
