You can ask me questions about ZenDesk tickets.
E.g. to check if there are any tickets which requires your attention
Do we have any open critical tickets?
Were there any tickets due during last 7 days?
E.g. to do some basic calculations
What is the average age of open tickets
What is the average age of open tickets created during last 7 days?
E.g. to list them
Which tickets were created during last 2 weeks
Which tickets are due tomorrow
And finally, you can ask for me to show them to you
Can I see them
Show me.

Pro-tip, keep the results windowoo open. It will be updated in real-time as you ask further questions.

Looking forward to working with you!
